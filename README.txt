This code implements an ETL pipeline that extracts, processes, and saves content from scientific articles. It reads URLs and PMCIDs from a CSV file, retrieves the corresponding web pages, parses key sections (e.g., abstract, introduction, methods), and extracts relevant text, references, and figure information. 
The processed data is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis or use. This pipeline is useful for automating the extraction of structured information from academic articles.
This code can be used with the URL obtained from the database created with the PubMed-abstract-database code.
